I am interested in Reliability Analysis, Uncertainty Quantification and P-box Modelling. I was mainly focused on inverse probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods for Uncertainty Quantification, the modelling of spatial and multi-variate uncertainty under scarce data using interval methods and grey-box modelling.
