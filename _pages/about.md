My research is focused on inverse probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods for Uncertainty Quantification, the modelling of spatial and multi-variate uncertainty under scarce data using interval methods and the application of high-dimensional measurement techniques such as Digital Image Correlation. Recently, I also initiated works in the field of grey-box modelling.
